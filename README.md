impro-visor-js
==============

Here are the awesome
[impro-visor](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/)
knowledge data converted to json format in order to use
it in browser/node environments.

The original files are in `./source` and the converted
output are in `./build`.

To process the files I used metalsmith. If you want to
do the conversion process: `node start`
